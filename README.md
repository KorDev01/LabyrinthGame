The Labyrinth is created randomly by using the [Recursive Backtracking algorithm](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2010/12/27/maze-generation-recursive-backtracking).

The game uses [LibGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com) as graphic engine.

The beta version of Labyrinth is available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.fhhgb.mc&ah=IsleyTOH7m3d_9NcAqyRxvoLxaw&hl=en).
